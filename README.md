### Hi there 👋


**Kkorbin/kkorbin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on expanding my github profile.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning building my portfolio/full-stack development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, but I am going to start searching for open-source projects to contribute too!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting myself setup to help other open-source projects!
- 💬 Ask me about my website or my cat 🐈
- 📫 How to reach me: korbinallseitz@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his

<! -- ⚡ Fun fact: -->
